AUDIT SUMMARY
Audit Summary
GENERAL OVERVIEW
cGMP Validation was contracted for the purpose of conducting a Mock FDA inspection of
the Quality Management System to determine if the activities performed there were
compliant with 21 CFR Part 211 and 503b FDA Guidance for Human Drug Compounding
Outsource Facilities. The audit was a two-day assessment which consisted of a facility
tour, process flow walk-throughs, reviewing documentation, and interviewing employees
to gain an understanding of how the facility operates and how well they are compliant
with the FDA regulation and their established SOPs.
In this report you will find:
 A full list of the systems reviewed.
 A list of findings (Observations, Concerns and Opportunities for Improvement).
 Recommendations for improvement.
Only areas where observations were noted are discussed in detail.

AUDIT SUMMARY
 Andrew Nunez – Senior Process Engineer
The full agenda was completed, and the facility tour was comprehensive. My overall
impression at the end of the audit was that the quality system is appropriate for the size
of the organization and type of operations conducted. During the audit there were
several issues noted that the organization should consider addressing as soon as
possible. These are discussed in detail in the next section of this report.

FINDINGS
Findings
Findings are classified using the following criteria:
Observation (Major):
 A condition which, if discovered by regulatory authorities such as the FDA, would
be considered a violation of the regulation and could result in the issuance of a
483 observation.
 A condition which may make a product unfit for use and likely to present a risk to
the user.
Observation (Minor):
 A condition, if uncorrected, might be cited by regulatory authorities as a violation
of the regulation.
 Isolated issues that if not corrected, would not cause risk to the user or product,
but are a deviation from GMPs.
 Significant numbers of minor findings in one system, which are indicative of a
systemic failure.
Opportunity For Improvement:
 Suggestions, if implemented, will contribute to a higher level of compliance, and
ensure better alignment with GMPs.

FINDINGS
LABELING
Observation 1 (Major).
211.125 Labeling Issuance:
(a)Strict control shall be exercised over labeling issued for use in drug product
labeling operations.
(b) Labeling materials issued for a batch shall be carefully examined for identity
and conformity to the labeling specified in the master or batch production
records.
(c) Procedures shall be used to reconcile the quantities of labeling issued, used,
and returned, and shall require evaluation of discrepancies found between the
quantity of drug product finished and the quantity of labeling issued when such
discrepancies are outside narrow preset limits based on historical operating
data.
While reviewing how labels are stored at the facility the investigator was shown the
storage room where the labels are kept. While in the storage room, the investigator
noticed a label counting device. When asked what its purpose was, it was pointed out
that this was the device that was used for issuing labels. Its specific purpose was to
count the number of labels that were being issued for a production work order.
When the investigator asked if the label counter was validated, the answer was no.
(f) Procedures shall be written describing in sufficient detail the control
procedures employed for the issuance of labeling; such written procedures shall
be followed.
When entering the labeling room, the investigator noticed that badge access was
required. The question was asked who was authorized to enter the labeling room
period specifically who had badge access to the area. It was not known at that
particular moment, however QA staff provided a list from the security system
software that showed nearly everyone in the facility had access to the room.

FINDINGS
VENDOR QUALIFICATIONS
Observation 2 (Major).
Subpart E - Control of Components and Drug Product Containers and Closures
Sec. 211.80 General requirements.
(a) There shall be written procedures describing in sufficient detail the receipt,
identification, storage, handling, sampling, testing, and approval or rejection of
components and drug product containers and closures; such written procedures
shall be followed.
While reviewing the vendor qualification SOP, it was not clear how vendors are
categorized according to criticality. Looking at the approved suppliers list, an
examination of the vendor who supplies vials was made to determine if they were
qualified according to the SOP. A review of the file indicated that the vendor should
be qualified by performing an audit. The record showed that the vial supplier had not
been audited, and that the vials were accepted on a COA. This was also true for other
vendors who were considered critical suppliers.
RECORDS AND REPORTS
Observation 3 (Minor).
Sec. 211.186 Master production and control records.
(b) Master production and control records shall include:
(9) Complete manufacturing and control instructions, sampling and testing
procedures, specifications, special notations, and precautions to be followed.
In the mixing section of the master batch record the settings for the mixer had only
the lower RPM limit setting for the mixer, but not an upper RPM limit setting.
Equipment settings listed in the master batch record should contain the full operating
range that is allowed to be set by the operator. This range normally comes from the
equipment validation records.

FINDINGS
FACILITIES
Observation 4 (Minor).
211.56 Sanitation: Any building used in the manufacture, processing, packing, or
holding of a drug product shall be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition,
Any such building shall be free of infestation by rodents, birds, insects, and other
vermin (other than laboratory animals).
During the facility tour the investigator noticed the absence of insect light traps
around the delivery doctors. Insect light traps are in an integral part of a pest control
program and are key in controlling the intrusion of flying insects.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
Recommendations for Improvement
Observation 1 (Major).
Labeling
The label counting machine that we looked at needs to be validated. It can be a simple PQ
where you run three sets of labels and verify that all three sets were counted accurately.
Make sure you write a protocol for that and approve it before you start any testing period
record the results in the protocol and then write a final report once you've executed the
protocol to summarize the results. Once you have all those reports completed, validation
is considered complete, and you should be fine after that.
With regard to the label room access, review the list that we had printed out and distill
that down to only those people that actually need access to that room. That should be no
more than three to four people at most. Remember, just because someone is a manager
or officer of the company does not mean they automatically get access. Guard those labels
like you would guard controlled substances.
Observation 2 (Major).
Vendor Qualifications
Your vendor qualification process is going to need some work. Step one, categorize your
vendors as category 1, 2 or 3. Category 1 suppliers have direct impact on the product,
which means these suppliers provide you with materials that go directly into, or touch
the product. Category 2 suppliers are those suppliers that provide materials that do not
go directly into the product but are used in the manufacture of your products. An
example of a category 2 supplier would be a supplier who provides secondary packaging.
Category 3 suppliers our suppliers that provide everything else that does not go into the
manufacturer of the product. Example of a category 3 supplier would be a supplier who
provides janitorial services for the office.
The next step is to decide how you're going to qualify each of the categories of suppliers.
Category 1 suppliers typically are qualified by an on-site audit of the facility and
manufacturing process. Category 2 suppliers can be an audit, but is typically done
Page 9
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
through some type of survey that is sent to the supplier that they complete and send
back. Oftentimes you can also ask for certificates such as ISO certificates. Once you've
categorized the suppliers, and determined how you're going to qualify each category of
supplier, the next step is to perform the qualifications as per your SOP.
Observation 3 (Minor).
Records and Reports
Production equipment settings should be transferred into the master batch record directly
from the validation protocol. For example, when the mixer was qualified using a protocol
as you were incrementally increasing RPMs on the mixer, there should have been a setting
where the batch would begin properly mix. As the RPMS continued to increased
incrementally, you would eventually reach an upper limit where the batch was no longer
in specification, or you reached the upper equipment capability limit. So, the operating
range would then be the lower limit where the batch first came into specification and the
upper limit would be where the batch started to go out of specification. Typically, you
would increase 10% above the lower limit and decrease 10% below the upper limit to give
yourself a buffer from the actual limits.
Observation 4 (Minor).
Facilities
As I mentioned previously, flying insect light traps are an integral part of a good pest
control program. When you look for these on the market for purchase, be sure you're
getting a light trap and not a bug zapper. The difference between the two being that an
insect trap uses UV lights with a glue board behind it, where the insects stick to the glue
board. A bug zapper, which is what I’m sure most of you are familiar with, is a device that
has a light that attracts the insect and then an electrical circuit that electrocutes the insect
once it makes contact with it. You don't want this because it will cause more
contamination from exploding insects that fly into the device. So be sure you get a light
trap and not a zapper.
Page 10
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
The other key part to installing these devices is to be sure that wherever it is installed it is
not visible from the outside at night. An example would be you would not want to install it
on a wall where you could see through an exterior window from the outside and see the
light trap on the inside. This attracts bugs to your building, so be sure that the light traps
are not visible from the outside so that you don't attract bugs towards the building. These
traps should only be catching those pests that penetrate the building when doors are open
such as a dock door or an entryway. Consult with your pest control company as to where
the best location for these devices would be, but also be mindful that it is positioned as I
outlined as not all pest control companies may know this tip.

SUMMARY
Summary
My overall impression at the end of the audit was that the quality system is appropriate
for the size of the organization, and the staff are very well trained and working in a way
that is compliant with current good manufacturing practices.
In total there were four observations, some with multiple parts. The observations were
significant, especially the labeling observations, which if not corrected could result in
product mislabeling. Mislabeling is the number one issue leading to recalls. All
observations should be corrected as soon as possible as each area can have a significant
impact on product quality.
