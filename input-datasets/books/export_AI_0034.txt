### Title
VanRx Pressure Differential Alarm

### Description
On 30AUG2024 during the beginning of batch 355 (VanRx Batch 355 is Production order 10000081), alarm Fault#97 DSI Transfer Door Is Not Open occurred. This fault triggers as a result of the DSI Transfer Door not being in an open position. The fault occurred while the Tray Robot was in position to pick up the second vial nest tub from the DSI. In attempt to resolve the fault, the operator attempted to try to close and re-open the DSI door via the HMI, however the door did not move.

Engineering then began to troubleshoot with remote support from the vendor (Cytiva) during the batch, site CDA was first verified and found to be supplying the appropriate pressure to the machine. Next the pneumatic Tubing and Solenoid valve(s) associated with the DSI Opening and Closing (SV103:1 and SV103:2) and DSI Unlocking (SV103A) were manually actuated. It was found that when Engineering manually actuated SV103A the DSI Transfer Door was able to fully Open and Fault#97 cleared. Engineering then attempted to close the DSI Transfer Door via the HMI, however the DSI Transfer Door did not close. SV103A was again manually actuated and DSI Transfer Door closed fully. However, as a result of how quickly the DSI Transfer Door closed, it triggered a pressure differential in the DSI Chamber resulting in alarms Fault#836 DSI Contaminated Production Atmosphere Exposed By Pressure Drop Below 5Pa, Fault#814 PDT150 Filling Isolator Pressure Outside Recipe Limits, and Fault#834 PDT250 DSI Isolator Pressure Outside Limits. Fault#836 will occur when DSI pressure falls below contamination pressure threshold (5Pa). As a result of alarm Fault# 836, the Decontaminated Status of the DSI changed to contaminated and required the DSI to be re-VHP'd. However, since validated parameters for components in the DSI allow for one VHP cycle the batch required to be aborted. This includes scrapping the components that were exposed to VHP. 

After the batch was aborted, Engineering continued the troubleshooting. They first verified that the DSI Transfer Door was able to be opened and closed via the HMI. Upon successfully opening and closing the DSI Transfer Door on the HMI, an engineering test batch was performed with six (6) vial tubs and two (2) container closure tubs. During this test batch it was confirmed that the fault could not be replicated. In an effort to determine a root cause, data from specific machine tags was sent to the vendor (Cytiva) to further assess and aid in determining a root cause. After the engineering test batch, the machine was handed back to manufacturing for continue of batch 10000081. 

Additional components were issued to this workorder and a new batch was restarted on the HMI.
