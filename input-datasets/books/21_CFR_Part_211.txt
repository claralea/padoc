cryogenic medical gas containers. For the purposes of this section, a “portable cryogenic medical
gas container” is one that is capable of being transported and is intended to be attached to a
medical gas supply system within a hospital, health care entity, nursing home, other facility, or home
health care setting, or is a base unit used to fill small cryogenic gas containers for use by individual
patients. The term does not include cryogenic containers that are not designed to be connected to a
medical gas supply system,e.g., tank trucks, trailers, rail cars, or small cryogenic gas containers for
use by individual patients (including portable liquid oxygen units as defined at§ 868.5655 of this
chapter).
Label and coloring requirements.The labeling specified at§ 201.328(a) of this chaptermust be
affixed to the container in a manner that does not interfere with other labeling and such that it is not
susceptible to becoming worn or inadvertently detached during normal use. Each such label as well
as materials used for coloring medical gas containers must be reasonably resistant to fading,
durable when exposed to atmospheric conditions, and not readily soluble in water.

§ 211.132 Tamper-evident packaging requirements for over-the-counter (OTC) human drug
products.
Link to an amendment published at89 FR 51769, June 18, 2024.
(a) General.The Food and Drug Administration has the authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (the act) to establish a uniform national requirement for tamper-evident packaging of OTC drug
products that will improve the security of OTC drug packaging and help assure the safety and
effectiveness of OTC drug products. An OTC drug product (except a dermatological, dentifrice, insulin, or
21 CFR 211.132(a) (enhanced display) page 17 of 30
21 CFR Part 211 (up to date as of 7/24/2025)
Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Finished Pharmaceuticals 21 CFR 211.132(b)
lozenge product) for retail sale that is not packaged in a tamper-resistant package or that is not properly
labeled under this section is adulterated under section 501 of the act or misbranded under section 502 of
the act, or both.
(b) Requirements for tamper-evident package.
(1) Each manufacturer and packer who packages an OTC drug product (except a dermatological,
dentifrice, insulin, or lozenge product) for retail sale shall package the product in a tamper-evident
package, if this product is accessible to the public while held for sale. A tamper-evident package is
one having one or more indicators or barriers to entry which, if breached or missing, can reasonably
be expected to provide visible evidence to consumers that tampering has occurred. To reduce the
likelihood of successful tampering and to increase the likelihood that consumers will discover if a
product has been tampered with, the package is required to be distinctive by design or by the use of
one or more indicators or barriers to entry that employ an identifying characteristic (e.g., a pattern,
name, registered trademark, logo, or picture). For purposes of this section, the term “distinctive by
design” means the packaging cannot be duplicated with commonly available materials or through
commonly available processes. A tamper-evident package may involve an immediate-container and
closure system or secondary-container or carton system or any combination of systems intended to
provide a visual indication of package integrity. The tamper-evident feature shall be designed to and
shall remain intact when handled in a reasonable manner during manufacture, distribution, and retail
display.
(2) In addition to the tamper-evident packaging feature described inparagraph (b)(1)of this section, any
two-piece, hard gelatin capsule covered by this section must be sealed using an acceptable tamper-
evident technology.
(c) Labeling.
(1) In order to alert consumers to the specific tamper-evident feature(s) used, each retail package of an
OTC drug product covered by this section (except ammonia inhalant in crushable glass ampules,
containers of compressed medical oxygen, or aerosol products that depend upon the power of a
liquefied or compressed gas to expel the contents from the container) is required to bear a
statement that:
(i) Identifies all tamper-evident feature(s) and any capsule sealing technologies used to comply
withparagraph (b)of this section;
(ii) Is prominently placed on the package; and
(iii) Is so placed that it will be unaffected if the tamper-evident feature of the package is breached
or missing.
(2) If the tamper-evident feature chosen to meet the requirements inparagraph (b)of this section uses
an identifying characteristic, that characteristic is required to be referred to in the labeling statement.
For example, the labeling statement on a bottle with a shrink band could say “For your protection,
this bottle has an imprinted seal around the neck.”
(d) Request for exemptions from packaging and labeling requirements.A manufacturer or packer may request
an exemption from the packaging and labeling requirements of this section. A request for an exemption is
required to be submitted in the form of a citizen petition under§ 10.30 of this chapterand should be
clearly identified on the envelope as a “Request for Exemption from the Tamper-Evident Packaging Rule.”
The petition is required to contain the following:

21 CFR Part 211 (up to date as of 7/24/2025)
Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Finished Pharmaceuticals 21 CFR 211.132(d)(1)
(1) The name of the drug product or, if the petition seeks an exemption for a drug class, the name of the
drug class, and a list of products within that class.
(2) The reasons that the drug product's compliance with the tamper-evident packaging or labeling
requirements of this section is unnecessary or cannot be achieved.
(3) A description of alternative steps that are available, or that the petitioner has already taken, to reduce
the likelihood that the product or drug class will be the subject of malicious adulteration.
(4) Other information justifying an exemption.
(e) OTC drug products subject to approved new drug applications.Holders of approved new drug applications
for OTC drug products are required under§ 314.70 of this chapterto provide the agency with notification
of changes in packaging and labeling to comply with the requirements of this section. Changes in
packaging and labeling required by this regulation may be made before FDA approval, as provided under§
314.70(c) of this chapter. Manufacturing changes by which capsules are to be sealed require prior FDA
approval under§ 314.70(b) of this chapter.
(f) Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970.This section does not affect any requirements for “special
packaging” as defined under§ 310.3(l) of this chapterand required under the Poison Prevention
Packaging Act of 1970.
