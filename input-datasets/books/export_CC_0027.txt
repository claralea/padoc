Use of Obsolete version of form

### Description
Visual Inspection of lot 10000096 Nor-epinephrine bitartrate began on 18 OCT 2024 using the current effective version of DAL-FRM-0086, version 3.0.&amp;amp;nbsp;DAL-FRM-0086 had been updated to align with the recent launch of manual filling. Minor updates included removing the VanRx &amp;amp;quot;carousel&amp;amp;quot; descriptor and the defect classification of the cosmetic cap defects.&amp;amp;nbsp;
The operations team printed the current effective version from the ACE controlled document management system to utilize them for the inspection and no previous versions of DAL-FRM-0086&amp;amp;nbsp;were present at their workstations.

An additional visual inspector, Employee ID 100028, joined the inspection on 21 Oct 2024. When he joined, he utilized a previous version of DAL-FRM-0086&amp;amp;nbsp;(Version 2.0), which was residing on top of one of the inspection booths from a previous inspection that did not ultimately require all copies of the form that&amp;amp;nbsp;were printed at the time. The visual inspection was completed&amp;amp;nbsp;by the operational team and then it proceeded to the QA AQL step. The lot met all production, and QA visual inspections so it was released for packaging.

Utilization of the previous version of the form was detected during QA batch record review.

Employee ID 100028) is a qualified visual inspector and using the previous version of the form did not pose any risk as the inspection was completed as per DAL-SOP-0222 Visual Inspection of Finished Drug Products and Preparations. There were no new critical or major defects added to the Form which the associate would not have responded to via utilization of the previous version, thus there was no patient risk introduced.

As the associate was working on other tasks when the inspection started, and they were added later, they missed completing on the new version of the Form and were not present when the current effective versions were printed and distributed on 18OCT2024.
