EQUIP Scenarios/ Study Designs
Scenario 1: Small Batch Production for Immediate Use:
Situation: A mobile manufacturing unit produces multiple small batches (e.g., 100
doses) of an injectable drug for immediate use in a hospital setting during a public
health emergency.
Challenge: Traditional stability testing and reserve sample requirements (21 CFR
211.170) are not feasible due to the small batch size and immediate use.
Study: Stability of Small Batches of Injectable Drugs in Mobile Manufacturing Units
Objective: To determine the stability of small batches (e.g., 100 doses) of injectable
drugs produced in mobile manufacturing units for immediate use.
Design:
• A mobile manufacturing unit will produce multiple small batches of an injectable
drug.
• Samples from each batch will be stored under various conditions (e.g., room
temperature, refrigerated, frozen).
• Samples will be analyzed at regular intervals (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 hours) for key
quality attributes (e.g., potency, purity, sterility).
• The impact of manufacturing moves on product stability will be evaluated by
comparing the stability of samples from batches produced before and after a
move.
Data Analysis:
• Stability data will be analyzed to determine the shelf life of the drug product
under different storage conditions.
• The effect of manufacturing moves on product stability will be assessed.
• The data will be used to develop alternative stability data requirements for
immediate use products.
Expected Outcome:
• The study will provide data to support alternative stability data requirements for
immediate use products produced in mobile manufacturing units.
• The study will also help to assess the impact of manufacturing moves on product
stability.
Scenario 2: Relocation of a Mobile Manufacturing Unit
Situation: A mobile manufacturing unit, previously qualified and operating at one
location, is relocated to a new site (e.g., from one hospital to another).
Challenge: Ensuring continued compliance with cGMP requirements (21 CFR 211)
after relocation, particularly regarding building and facilities (Subpart C).
Study: Re-qualification of Mobile Manufacturing Units after Relocation
Objective: To determine the re-qualification steps necessary after relocation of a mobile
manufacturing unit.
Design:
• A mobile manufacturing unit will be relocated to a new site.
• The unit will be re-qualified according to a pre-defined protocol.
• The protocol will include steps to verify the integrity of the unit's structure,
equipment, and systems.
• Environmental monitoring will be conducted to assess the impact of the new
location on the unit's environment.
Data Analysis:
• Re-qualification data will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the re-
qualification protocol.
• The impact of the new location on the unit's environment will be assessed.
• The data will be used to develop re-qualification requirements for mobile
manufacturing units.
Expected Outcome:
• The study will provide data to support re-qualification requirements for mobile
manufacturing units.
• The study will also help to assess the impact of relocation on the unit's
environment.
Scenario 3: Rapid Changeover between Different Drug Products
Situation: A mobile manufacturing unit needs to quickly switch production from one
drug product to another to address changing needs during a public health emergency.
Challenge: Meeting cGMP requirements for cleaning validation and preventing cross-
contamination between products.
Study: Cleaning Validation for Rapid Changeover between Different Drug Products in
Mobile Manufacturing Units
Objective: To determine the cleaning validation data required for rapid changeover
between different drug products in mobile manufacturing units.
Design:
• A mobile manufacturing unit will be used to produce multiple drug products.
• The unit will be cleaned between each product changeover.
• Cleaning effectiveness will be assessed using various methods (e.g., visual
inspection, swabbing, rinse sampling).
• The impact of cleaning on product quality will be evaluated.
Data Analysis:
• Cleaning validation data will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of
cleaning procedures.
• The impact of cleaning on product quality will be assessed.
• The data will be used to develop cleaning validation requirements for rapid
changeover in mobile manufacturing units.
Expected Outcome:
• The study will provide data to support cleaning validation requirements for rapid
changeover in mobile manufacturing units.
• The study will also help to assess the impact of cleaning on product quality.
Scenario 4: Operator Training for On-Site Personnel
Situation: On-site personnel (e.g., hospital staff) with limited formal training in
pharmaceutical manufacturing will operate a mobile manufacturing unit.
Challenge: Meeting cGMP training requirements (21 CFR 211) for these personnel.
Study: Operator Training for On-Site Personnel in Mobile Manufacturing Units
Objective: To determine the type of training program appropriate for on-site personnel
(e.g., hospital staff) with limited formal training in pharmaceutical manufacturing.
Design:
• A training program will be developed for on-site personnel.
• The program will include both theoretical and practical components.
• The effectiveness of the training program will be evaluated through assessments
and performance monitoring.
Data Analysis:
• Training data will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the training
program.
• The impact of training on operator performance will be assessed.
• The data will be used to develop training requirements for on-site personnel in
mobile manufacturing units.
Expected Outcome:
• The study will provide data to support training requirements for on-site personnel
in mobile manufacturing units.
• The study will also help to assess the impact of training on operator performance.
Scenario 5: Master Production and Control Record (MPCR)
Management
Situation: EQUIP-A Pharma utilizes multiple mobile manufacturing units, each capable
of producing multiple drug products.
Challenge: Ensuring clarity and compliance in MPCR management.
Study: MPCR Management in Mobile Manufacturing Units
Objective: To determine the appropriate approach for MPCR management in mobile
manufacturing units.
Design:
• Different approaches to MPCR management will be evaluated (e.g., unit-specific
MPCRs, product-specific MPCRs).
• The effectiveness of each approach will be assessed in terms of clarity,
compliance, and efficiency.
Data Analysis:
• MPCR management data will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of
different approaches.
• The data will be used to develop MPCR management requirements for mobile
manufacturing units.
Expected Outcome:
• The study will provide data to support MPCR management requirements for
mobile manufacturing units.
• The study will also help to identify the most effective approach for MPCR
management in this setting.
