### Title
Missed Post Line Clearance Verification

### Description
On 26MAR2024, After the reconciliation (Step 7.3.8) and Transfer of units out of room (Step 7.3.9), Step 7.3.10, the production post line clearance was performed by CV. As the day was completing the QA &amp;amp;quot;Verified By&amp;amp;quot; was still pending.

On 27MAR2025 the still pending Line Clearance was noted by QA prior to the start of any any manufacturing activities of a new lot. As it was the day after production completed the Line clearance the Quality Associate (CP) noted the difference and raised a Deviation as a conservative measure while evaluating if there was any product risk or procedural deviation.

The review determined that no subsequent visual inspection manufacturing steps occurred after visual inspection of Norepinephrine Lot 10000262. Room was verified by quality per DAL-SOP-0216 for room clearance on 27MAR2025 by Quality Management - CP. 

Room was free of all vials/tubs associated with the batch, all inspected units were removed from the visual inspection room and booths (Vial Reconciliation &amp;amp;quot;from visual&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;to packaging&amp;amp;quot; was performed with 100% reconciliation), and batch record/other documentation were removed (Full Batch Record was with the Lot in the packaging room).
