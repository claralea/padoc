{"chunk":"### Description\nDescription:\nEvent description: It was noted during batch record review that some signatures were missing from the visual inspection and packing sections of two Batch Records. \nSpecifically:\nLot 10000188: Steps: 7.3.9, 7.3.10, 7.3.11, 8.2 and 8.8. \nLot 1000189: Page 45, Section 8.8 and Challenge Form","book":"export_DEV_0017"}
{"chunk":"Refer to DAL-INV-0010 for additional investigation.\nThe missing signatures posed no product impact for the following reasons:","book":"export_DEV_0017"}
{"chunk":"1. Step 7.3.9 - 7.3.11: Lot was removed from for an open investigation and was put under quality hold. The Line clearance was documented on the upcoming Lot 10000189 to verify all the components and batch record are from current working batch so there was no impact.","book":"export_DEV_0017"}
{"chunk":"2. A missed &amp;amp;ldquo;Verified By&amp;amp;rdquo; signature was missed to verify lot information and expiration date on the bottle of IPA before cleaning the work surface for packaging. Expiration date mentioned on the batch record was 16 FEB 2025 which was within the expiration date of use","book":"export_DEV_0017"}
{"chunk":". Furthermore, the step is for routine equipment cleaning and not for a classified environment.","book":"export_DEV_0017"}
{"chunk":"3. The labeling issuance signature was still pending. However QA retained the labels in their controlled access area, they were counted by QA and issued to the Lots as intended. However, the packaging associate did not provide the batch record back to the Quality Unit to sign it, so the signature was still pending after issuance","book":"export_DEV_0017"}
{"chunk":". The labels were correct, the quantity was correct and objective evidence is present on the batch record. Furthermore, the quantity of vial labels issued was confirmed later from section 8.7 &amp;amp;quot;component reconciliation&amp;amp;quot; which shows that 900 labels were issued, and the percent reconciliation met specification for both lots.","book":"export_DEV_0017"}
{"chunk":"4.As per the procedure label copy, carton copy and insert copy must be verified prior to packaging the lot. Upon reviewing the batch record it was observed that reviewed by signature was missed by quality personnel on the batch record because the lot was packaged late in the evening","book":"export_DEV_0017"}
{"chunk":". Lot information printed on the carton and label was verified later from the copies attached to the Batch record to make sure all the coded information is correct on the packaged lot.","book":"export_DEV_0017"}
{"chunk":"5.Online system challenges were performed by a trained and qualified associate but the &amp;amp;ldquo;Verified By&amp;amp;rdquo; step was not performed. The previous lot, and subsequent lot both passed, and the operator was qualified to perform the step. This demonstrates the equipment was operating as intended","book":"export_DEV_0017"}
{"chunk":". In addition, all QA AQL steps were performed which met specification.","book":"export_DEV_0017"}
